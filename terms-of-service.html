<h3>SECTION 3 – BILLING AND PAYMENTS</h3>
<p>
As a Member, you agree to the following benefits and Terms: You must provide us and keep us up to date with accurate contact and payment information, including name, shipping address, and credit or debit card number. We save your payment information for ease of future shipments and charges. All such personal information is subject to the Privacy Policy. You are responsible for any fees or charges your issuing bank or credit card provider may charge you. If your payment to us is returned for any reason, we may bill your account again directly and seek payment by another method including a mailed statement. Any account changes made after the last day of each month should not be expected to reflect on the subscription until the following shipping period. In an effort to get boxes to our subscribers as soon as possible, we begin processing shipments prior to the signup cutoff. As a result, all address updates must be made within 48 hours prior to the subscription renewal date (see “Your Subscription Contract” below for renewal date information) to ensure they are correctly reflected on your shipment. Our shipping service does not include the forwarding with your mail to an updated address. Any forwarding fees incurred will not be reimbursed or credited to your subscription.

Your subscription will be automatically extended for successive periods, at the then-current subscription rate. To cancel your subscription at any time, you must contact support using the form on this website at least 48 hours prior to your next scheduled renewal date, or cancel your subscription online at tokyotreat.com to avoid charge. All subscriptions are renewed on the same date as you signup. Any changes in your subscription will be applicable on the next renewal date. If you cancel, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term. TokyoTreat may submit periodic charges (e.g., monthly) without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice that you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your payment method within the 48-hour notice requirement. If you cancel your subscription, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. Subscription reactivation will automatically generate an invoice for new order under your current plan for the current order period. TokyoTreat reserves the right to change the plan and price of the services (TokyoTreat, YumeTwins, and nomakenolife) with or without advanced notice to subscribers. We also reserve the right to revoke your subscription at any time.
